```

- See here for how to add **[$uperpowers](https://github.com/valgaze/speedybot/blob/master/docs/superpowers.md)** to give your bot extra capabilities (get/set conversational contexts, store data, retrieve files, 3rdparty integrations, etc)


| **Command** | **Desc** |
| --- | --- |
| ```npm run setup``` | Setup dependency and bundle |
| ```npm run dev``` | Start with live-reload on code-changes |
| ```npm run ui``` | Boot web-based debug panel | 
| ```npm start``` | Start chat agent |
| ```npm start:server``` | Start server (you'll need to set ```webhookUrl``` in settings/config.json) |


Get a **[new](https://developer.webex.com/my-apps/new/bot)** or **[existing](https://developer.webex.com/my-apps)** token and save to **[config.json](./settings/config.json)**


<details><summary>Information for booting with a server</summary>

To boot with a server, deploy it and append "/speedybotwebhook" to the address

```json
{
    "token":"aaa-bbb-ccc-ddd",
    "webhookUrl":"https://123-45-678-910-987.ngrok.io/speedybotwebhook"
}
```

Boot the server with:

```sh
npm run start:server
```

If you want to test webhooks without deploying, you can obtain a 2-hour tunnel for testing with the following command

```
npx speedybot tunnel <port_number>
```

With the tunnel address, use it under webhookUrl

Speedybot instruments on top of the incredibly useful **[webex-node-bot-framework](https://github.com/WebexSamples/webex-node-bot-framework)** and steps through the fastest path to a working bot and provides some convenience features

## Adding a new chat handler

With Speedybot, all you need to worry about is the **[settings directory](https://github.com/valgaze/speedybot/tree/master/settings)** directory with two files:

**1. config.json:** This is where you'll put your bot access token and the "tunnel" (or webhost) where your bot is reachable from webhooks

**2. handlers.ts:** A list of "handlers" that respond to keywords

Example handler:

```js
{
	keyword: ['hello', 'hey', 'yo', 'watsup', 'hola'],
	handler(bot, trigger) {
		// bot: https://github.com/WebexSamples/webex-node-bot-framework#bot
		// trigger: https://github.com/WebexSamples/webex-node-bot-framework#trigger
		const reply = `Heya how's it going ${trigger.person.displayName}?`
		bot.say(reply)
	},
	helpText: `**hello** A handler that greets the user`
}
```

## Special keywords

There are a few "special" keywords you can use to "listen" to special events:

- *<@submit>*: Handler that will run anytime data is submitted from an **[Adaptive Card](https://developer.webex.com/docs/api/guides/cards)**

- *<@catchall>*: Handler that will run on **every** message received (can be useful to dispatch messages to natural language services like **[DialogFlow](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow)** or **[Lex](https://aws.amazon.com/lex/)**)

- *<@fileupload>*: Handler that will fire on **every** file-upload or file-attachment sent to the bot

- *<@help>*: There is a built-in help handler by default (it will print out all of your custom handler's helpTexts from settings/handlers.ts), but use this if you want to make your own

- *<@spawn>*: Gets called whenever a user adds your bot to a new space-- there are some caveats, however, to its behavior, so if you think you'll need this, see **[here](https://github.com/WebexSamples/webex-node-bot-framework/blob/master/README.md#spawn)**, **[here](https://developer.webex.com/blog/a-deeper-dive-into-the-webex-bot-framework-for-node-js)** or the **[resources page](https://github.com/valgaze/speedybot/blob/master/docs/resources.md)** for all the details

- *<@despawn>*: Opposite of spawn, see **[here](https://github.com/WebexSamples/webex-node-bot-framework/#despawn)** for details

ex. Tell the bot "sendcard" to get a card, type into the card & tap submit, catch submission using *<@submit>* and echo back to user

```ts
export default [{
        keyword: '<@submit>',
        handler(bot, trigger) {
            bot.say(`Submission received! You sent us ${JSON.stringify(trigger.attachmentAction.inputs)}`)
        },
        helpText: 'Special handler that fires when data is submitted'
    },
    {
        keyword: 'sendcard',
        handler(bot, trigger) {
            bot.say('One card on the way...')

            // Adapative Card: https://developer.webex.com/docs/api/guides/cards
            const cardPayload = {
                "$schema": "http://adaptivecards.io/schemas/adaptive-card.json",
                "type": "AdaptiveCard",

                        "text": "If you see this card, everything is working"
                    }]
                }, {

                    "id": "inputData",
                    "placeholder": "What's on your mind?"
                }],
                "actions": [{
                    "type": "Action.OpenUrl",
                    "title": "Take a moment to celebrate",

                    "title": "Submit",
                    "data": {
                        "cardType": "inputForm"
                    }
                }]
            }

            bot.sendCard(cardPayload, 'Your client does not currently support Adaptive Cards')
        },
        helpText: 'Sends an Adaptive Card with an input field to the user'
    }
]
